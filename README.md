# T-Mobile Valid Email Checker
A program written in Python using selenium web drivers and a list of T-Mobile emails to verify the validity of the email inputted.
Using rotating proxies and multi-threaded chrome drivers to ensure effective CPM rates.

Download the latest Chrome Drivers at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads, outdated drivers will cause an error while executing code.

Line 10 "file = r"C:\Users\Ruthless Economy PC\Desktop\Gemini Webdriver\combo176047.txt"" must be changed to match the file location of T-Mobile emails.

Line 49 "browser = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r'C:\Users\Ruthless Economy PC\Desktop\Gemini Webdriver\chromedriver.exe')" must be changed to match the file path you save the chrome driver to.
